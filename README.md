# 🌐 Personal Web Portfolio

This is my personal web portfolio — a place where I showcase who I am, what I do, and what I’ve built.

## 🎯 Inspiration

This portfolio is **heavily inspired by the [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) [ML4W](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles) dynamic tiling window manager**.

I recently discovered Hyprland and immediately loved its minimal yet powerful tiling layout. Using it daily has significantly boosted my productivity — so I decided to bring that same clean and organized feel to my web portfolio.
